# SuperStylish
A collection of free custom stylesheets that provide a cleaner, more modern, and alternative look (plus bugfixes!) to select websites. This repository includes the source for the [SuperStylish website](https://analytalica.github.io/SuperStylish/), which is hosted (and can be found) on the gh-pages branch.

The source for the featured stylesheets are stored in individual repositories, also on GitHub, which can be found here:

 - [**SuperPiazza** source](https://github.com/analytalica/SuperPiazza)
 - [**SuperUTDirect** source](https://github.com/analytalica/SuperUTDirect)

Happy styling!
